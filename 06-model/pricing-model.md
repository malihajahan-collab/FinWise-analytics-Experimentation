> Module 6 · Pricing & Monetization

## Step 1 · Assess FinWise’s monetization stage

| Field | FinWise decision |
| --- | --- |
| **Current stage** | **Stage 2 · Revenue Expansion** |
| **Evidence** | FinWise has **$10M in ARR**, showing that businesses will pay for its financial-management value. Yet only **128 of 6,424 trials convert to paid (1.99%)**, so the central constraint is monetizing product value after it is experienced, rather than proving that any value exists. |

FinWise is not at Stage 3 Optimization: a 1.99% trial-to-paid rate and 40% one-year paid retention indicate that the value-to-payment boundary and recurring value proposition still need structural work before price-point optimization.

## Step 2 · Select the pricing model

| Field | FinWise decision |
| --- | --- |
| **Recommended model** | **Subscription**, delivered through the existing reverse trial. FinWise’s value is ongoing: connected data, refreshed cash-flow forecasts, material-change alerts, and recurring financial actions become more useful as the business continues operating. A recurring subscription matches that continuous value better than a one-off transaction fee, advertising, or a broad unrestricted free tier. |
| **Key trade-off** | The trial must allow a user to receive the first personalized forecast and action before payment is requested; gating that insight earlier would reduce the Module 4 activation signals. But leaving ongoing forecast refreshes and alerts ungated after the trial would make the paid subscription less necessary. The boundary should therefore be between a first realized insight and the continuing, automatically refreshed cash plan. |

## Step 3 · Make the recommendation

| Field | FinWise decision |
| --- | --- |
| **Recommendation** | **Repackage the paid subscription around “Cash Plan Continuity.”** New trial users receive the first connected-account forecast and recommended action. After they review that action, the paid Cash Plan subscription unlocks ongoing automatic forecast refreshes, material cash-buffer alerts, weekly action reviews, and additional connected accounts. |
| **Justification** | This preserves and targets the Module 4 leading indicator, `personalized_cashflow_action_reviewed`: no paywall appears before the user reaches the first value event, and the paid boundary is shown immediately after it. It also connects payment to the recurring Cash Plan Freshness behavior from Module 3, giving users a concrete reason to continue rather than a generic request to upgrade. Improving conversion from the existing trial base reduces the revenue pressure to keep increasing paid-acquisition spend. |
| **The pricing bet** | **Packaging matched to value.** FinWise is validating whether the paid boundary belongs at ongoing cash-plan continuity—not at initial setup, a generic feature list, or a different sticker price. |

### What changes for the user

| Moment | Trial value | Paid Cash Plan value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First value event | Connect one account, receive a first 30-day forecast, and review one recommended action. | — |
| After Aha | See the post-Aha continuation prompt tied to the forecast just reviewed. | Choose ongoing Cash Plan Continuity. |
| Ongoing use | Trial access remains limited to the reverse-trial period. | Automatic forecast refreshes, material-change alerts, weekly cash-plan reviews, and additional connected accounts. |

Do **not** test a price increase, a discount, or a broad freemium tier before validating this package boundary. The available data does not identify willingness to pay by segment or show that price level is the primary constraint.

## Step 4 · Pricing recommendation memo

**To:** FinWise Leadership Team  
**Subject:** Put the paid boundary at ongoing cash-plan value

FinWise is in **Revenue Expansion**, not price optimization. $10M ARR shows small businesses will pay for our financial-management value, but only 2% of trial users convert and only 40% of paid customers remain after one year. The constraint is not proving initial value; it is capturing value at the point users understand why they need FinWise continuously.

Keep the subscription and reverse-trial model. Repackage the paid offer around **Cash Plan Continuity**: every trial user can connect one account, receive a first 30-day cash-flow forecast, and review one recommended action. After that action review, paid access unlocks automatically refreshed forecasts, material cash-buffer alerts, weekly cash-plan reviews, and additional connected accounts.

This is a packaging bet, not a discount or price-increase bet. It preserves the leading activation behavior—`personalized_cashflow_action_reviewed`—by avoiding a paywall before users see personalized value. It then makes the paid decision concrete: maintain a current cash plan and receive timely actions as conditions change. Improving conversion from the existing trial base will increase the return on paid acquisition without requiring more spend.

Validate this with the post-Aha A/B test: show the Cash Plan Continuity prompt after users review their first recommended action, and measure trial-to-paid conversion through the reverse-trial period. Ship only if conversion improves without reducing seven-day cash-plan review.
